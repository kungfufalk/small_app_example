# Collection Manager
Many of us love to collect all sorts of items we find interesting, some valuable,
others only so in a personal way. Over time, it can be a challenge to stay on top
of everything we have added to our collections over the years.

It is quite easy to build a mobile tool or app that keeps track of everything in our collection. 

You can decide what aspects of the individual pieces should be noted.
The collection manager can be configured to record the value of an object,
the date it was acquired, the location where it is stored, and much more.
